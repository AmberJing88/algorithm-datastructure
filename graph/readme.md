#Data Structure of Graph
record the study prograss and problems of recursion, back tracking and DFS
backtracking remember: find the already fulfilled element, do continue; find the element not matched the conditions, do break; therefore, every time visite a new element, determin the validation first.
recursion method: backtracking and dfs similar to find the edge quickly and shortest path.
