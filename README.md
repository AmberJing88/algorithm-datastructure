 # Algorithms and datastructure
datastructure and algorithm in python
notiation practice
## 1. Array study and practice

## 2. recursion and Backtracking

## 3. linked list

## 4. stack and queue

## 5. tree
binary tree
build binary tree class 
did the traverse to the binarytree
preorder, inorder, postorder, BFS
add eulertour method
add tree recursion problems
## python varibles type
for int type: if i = 0:
                not i is True 
means i don't have value in int type
same instances like:
if a list = []: then not list is True
## string
kmp algorithm
usually used in 0 1 string
